  <a class="u-author" href="https://jgreforymcverry">I</a> am thinking I will keep the notes native to Kirby even though these have a title and treat them like a normal blog post with an h-entry. I added articles for my long form writing. I will use the  "notes" as blog posts. I will add a "status" for the <a href="https://indieweb.org/note">notes post type</a>. I already seperate blog post, articles, and notes so this makes sense. Plus seems way easier than stripping the title from notes.
